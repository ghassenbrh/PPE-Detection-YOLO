The dataset includes 3419 images.
Masks are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
